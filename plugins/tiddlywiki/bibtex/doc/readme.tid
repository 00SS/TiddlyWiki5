The BibTeX plugin provides a deserializer that can convert bibliographic entries in `.bib` files into individual tiddlers.

The conversion is as follows:

* `title` comes from citationKey
* `bibtex-entry-type` comes from entryType
* all `entryTags` are assigned to fields with the prefix `bibtex-`

The BibTeX plugin is based on the library [[bibtexParseJs by Henrik Muehe and Mikola Lysenko|https://github.com/ORCID/bibtexParseJs]].
