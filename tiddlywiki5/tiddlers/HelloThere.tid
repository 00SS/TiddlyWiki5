Welcome to TiddlyWiki5, an interactive wiki [[under development|ThisIsAlpha]] in JavaScript to run in the browser or under node.js. It is a reboot of TiddlyWiki, the now venerable, reusable non-linear personal web notebook first released in 2004.

Over the years, TiddlyWiki has earned an enduring role as a tool that people [[love using|Raves]] for its rich, interactive interface to [[manipulate complex data|TiddlyWikiConcepts]] with structure that doesn't easily fit into conventional tools like spreadsheets and wordprocessors. Because people can use it without needing any complicated server infrastructure, and because it is [[open source|OpenSourceLicense]], it has bought unprecedented freedom to people to keep their precious information under their own control. TiddlyWiki was originally created by JeremyRuston and is now a thriving [[open source|OpenSourceLicense]] project with a busy [[Community]] of independent developers.
