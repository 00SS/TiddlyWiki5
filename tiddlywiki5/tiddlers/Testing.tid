title: Testing

!Test Scripts

Three test scripts are provided, each as a Mac OS X `*.sh` bash script and a Windows `*.bat` batch file.

* `test.sh`/`test.bat` cooks the main tiddlywiki.com recipe for TiddlyWiki 2.6.5 and compares it with the results of the old build process (ie, running cook.rb and then opening the file in a browser and performing a 'save changes' operation). It also runs a series of wikifications tests that work off the data in `test/wikitests/`.
* `tw5.sh`/`tw5.bat` builds TiddlyWiki5 as a static HTML file
* `tw5s.sh`/`tw5s.bat` serves TiddlyWiki5 over HTTP on port 8080
