title: Introduction

TiddlyWiki is a personal notebook application based on a wiki application. In addition to a static Web-Site, TiddlyWiki is implemented as a single page application. This is a approach to build rich internet applications; it includes the possibility to put application logic into web-pages to make them dynamically. Furthermore this means the whole application is delivered in one HTML file, consisting of source code to dynamically change the view and behaviour of the application as well as the data of the application. During the runtime nothing must be loaded from a server to the TiddlyWiki application. The HTML file contains everything needed to start the application. TiddlyWiki is highly customisable because of a very sophisticated module concept. Except for a micro-kernel written in JavaScript the whole application consist of a custom data-structure called tiddlers and its own markup language called wikiText. Even the modules are realised as tiddlers.

The aim of this documentation is to give the reader an overview of the idea behind the TiddlyWiki application as well as its architecture. After reading the documentation the reader should have knowledge of how the overall application works and awareness of the points from which the functionality of the application can be extended.
