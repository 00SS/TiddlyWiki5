title: Hook: tc-opening-default-tiddlers-list
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

This hook allows plugins to add aditional tiddlers to those specified in [[$:/DefaultTiddlers]]. 

The function definition takes a list of tiddlers as it's argument and should return a modified list of tiddlers to display when the wiki is first loaded or the home button is pressed.  This hook is invoked after ``$tw.wiki.filterTiddlers`` is called on the contents of [[$:/DefaultTiddlers]] and it is therfore not correct to append additional filters to the list argument as they will not be  subsequently applied.
