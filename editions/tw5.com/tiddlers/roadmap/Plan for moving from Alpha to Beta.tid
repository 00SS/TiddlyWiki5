title: Plan for moving from Alpha to Beta

! Goals for moving to Beta

To move from alpha to beta, TiddlyWiki5 needs a better release and deployment process. At a minimum:

* Each release should be automatically assigned a unique revision number, with a simple manual process to bump the major or minor version number
* Each release should be available as a zip download on GitHub and tiddlywiki.com
* Releases should be automatically pushed to NPM
* A release note for end users should be automatically generated from the commits
** The process should allow for manual editing of the release note
* A clear distinction between a new release of the TW5 core plugins and revised content for the tw5.com website

It would also be nice to have:

* Automatic tweets from @TiddlyWiki announcing each release

! Tasks for moving to Beta

!! Update https://github.com/Jermolene/tiddlywiki.com

This is the repository for the content and build tools for tiddlywiki.com, forked from https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/tiddlywiki.com. It needs updating to includes both TW5 and TW classic, with a unified build and deployment process for the website.

The pull request will be merged when we switch into beta. Until then, we'll build to http://jermolene.github.com, meaning that http://five.tiddlywiki.com will be a replica of tiddlywiki.com post-beta switchover.

The basic build process for tw5.com is:

Preparation

* Update the content and commit as needed
* Pull down the correct version of TW5 for the build
* Pull down the content repos
* Fork tiddlywiki.github.com and pull it down

Build cycle

* Run the build scripts
* Review pull request for tiddlywiki.github.com

Deployment

* Merge pull request on github.com
