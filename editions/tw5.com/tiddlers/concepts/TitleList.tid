title: TitleList

A <<.def "title list">> is a line of text that presents one or more tiddler titles, strung together with a space between each one and the next.

If a title <<.em contains>> a space, it needs double square brackets around it:

`GettingStarted [[Discover TiddlyWiki]] Upgrading`

Title lists are used in various places, including PermaLinks and the ListField.

They are in fact the simplest case of a [[filter|Filters]].
