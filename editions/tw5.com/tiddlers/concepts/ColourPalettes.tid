A colour palette is a [[data tiddler|DataTiddlers]] that supplies a [[CSS]] colour value, such as ''yellow'' or ''#fe0'', for each of several colour names, like this:

```
page-background: #fe0
table-border: #ccc
...
```

Several palettes form part of the core. The system tiddler [[$:/palette]] always contains the title of the currently selected palette tiddler.

To retrieve the value of a named colour from the current palette, e.g. for use in a stylesheet tiddler, use the [[colour macro|$:/core/macros/CSS]]:

```
<<colour page-background>>
```

Palette tiddlers should have the following fields:

|!Name |!Value |
|title |Typically starting with `$:/` |
|type |`application/x-tiddler-dictionary` |
|tags |`$:/tags/Palette` |
|description |Displayed in the palette browser |
|text |`name: value` colour definitions |

By convention, each [[theme|Themes]] provides a default colour palette in the tiddler [[$:/config/DefaultPalette]]. Thus, setting the tiddler [[$:/theme]] to the string `$:/config/DefaultPalette` will revert to the palette packaged with the current theme (as long as it hasn't been redefined, since it is a shadow tiddler).
