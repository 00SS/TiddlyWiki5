Tiddlers are the fundamental units of information in TiddlyWiki. Tiddlers work best when they are as small as possible so that they can be reused by weaving them together different ways.

Other systems have analogous concepts with confusingly generic names: like "items", "entries", "entities", "nodes" or "records". TiddlyWiki takes the view that it is preferable to be confusingly distinctive.

Internally, tiddlers are a list of uniquely named values called fields. The only field that is required is the `title` field, but useful tiddlers also have a `text` field, and some or all of the standard fields listed in TiddlerFields.

Tiddlers are ubiquitous in TiddlyWiki. They are used to store everything from JavaScript code modules to the settings and state associated with the user interface.
