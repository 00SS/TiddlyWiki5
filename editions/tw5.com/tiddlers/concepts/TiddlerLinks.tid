Links between tiddlers are the foundation of structuring information within TiddlyWiki.

TiddlyWiki5 alters the appearance of tiddler links to convey additional information about the target of the link:

|!Link description |!Link appearance |
|To a tiddler that exists |[[LikeThis|TiddlerLinks]] |
|To a tiddler that doesn't exist |[[LikeThis|ATiddlerThatDoesntExist]] |
|To a shadow tiddler that has not been overridden |[[LikeThis|$:/core/copyright.txt]] |
|To a shadow tiddler that has been overridden by an ordinary tiddler |[[LikeThis|SiteTitle]] |

External links are shown like this: http://tiddlywiki.com/ or [[like this|http://tiddlywiki.com/]].
