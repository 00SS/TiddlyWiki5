title: Dominant Append
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A <<.def "dominant append">> is a frequent occurrence in [[filter|Filters]] processing.

Filters manipulate sets of items in which no item can appear more than once, and they often append one such set to another.

This is done in such a way that if the result would contain two copies of the same item, the <<.em earlier>> one is removed. The appended items thus dominate over any earlier duplicates.
