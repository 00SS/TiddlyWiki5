title: How to use TiddlyWiki5 as a standalone HTML file

! On desktop browsers

# Right-click on this link to an empty TiddlyWiki5 file and select "Save Link" to save it to your hard drive:
#* http://five.tiddlywiki.com/empty
# Open the file in your browser
# Make some changes to it. For example:
#* Create new tiddlers by clicking the new tiddler "+" icon in the sidebar
#* Edit existing tiddlers by clicking the edit tiddler "pencil" icon at their upper right
# Save your changes by clicking the "download" icon in the sidebar. What happens next depends on your browser:
## Newer browsers will ask for confirmation and then begin downloading your newly modified TiddlyWiki file, placing it in the default `Downloads` directory.
##* See GoogleChromeTips for some suggestions to streamline this process
## For older browsers, TiddlyWiki displays a dialogue including a link that you need to right-click and save
