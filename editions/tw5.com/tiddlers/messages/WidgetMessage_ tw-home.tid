title: WidgetMessage: tw-home
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The `tw-home` message refreshes the current page by removing any [[permalink|PermaLinks]] from the browser address bar, causing the re-display of the [[$:/DefaultTiddlers]], and re-initialisation of any plugin tiddlers. It does not require any properties on the `event` object.

The home message is usually generated with the ButtonWidget and is handled by the core.
