title: Filters involved in saving of single file eddition
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

There are two filters controlling saving TiddlyWiki as a standalone file.

* $:/config/SaverFilter determines which modified tiddlers trigger the dirty state
* $:/core/save/all determines which tiddlers are saved in the file
