The ~CommunitySearch wiki aggregates the content of many wikis from the community. It is updated automatically every day.

It lets you search for some specific content among a preselected list of wikis. The indexed content is mostly focused on TW usage, so you would typically use this search system to find information about a particular aspect of TiddlyWiki. Say for example that you want to learn how to make a table of content, type "table of content" in the [[CommunitySearch box|http://erwanm.github.io/tw-community-search/#CommunitySearch]] (also accessible in the default tiddler http://erwanm.github.io/tw-community-search/#GettingStarted). The search results are links to various wikis, and point directly to the specific tiddlers containing your request.
