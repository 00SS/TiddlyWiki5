! Unordered Lists

You can create unordered lists with `*` characters:

<<wikitext-example src:"* First list item
* Second list item
** A subitem
* Third list item
">>

! Ordered Lists

Ordered lists use `#` instead of `*`:

# First item
# Second item
# Third item

You can also mix ordered and unordered list items:

<<wikitext-example src:"* To do today
*# Eat
* To get someone else to do
*# This
*# That
*## And the other
">>

! CSS Classes

You can also assign a CSS class to an individual member of a list with this notation:

<<wikitext-example src:"* List One
*.MyClass List Two
* List Three
">>

! Mixing Lists and Block Quotes

Note that [[Block Quotes in WikiText]] can be mixed with lists. For example:

<<wikitext-example src:"* List One
** List Two
**> A quote
**> Another quote
* List Three
">>

! Paragraphs in Lists

Entries in the list are delimited with a linebreak, making it impossible to include linebreaks within a list entry. The workaround is to transclude paragraph content from another tiddler. For example:

```
* First entry
* <$transclude tiddler="MyTiddler" mode="block"/>
* Third entry
```
