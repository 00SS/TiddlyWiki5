Federatial Limited is a software consultancy founded by JeremyRuston specializing in understanding the impact of the web on the way that we work together.

Through human history we have used hierarchies to organize ourselves to undertake big challenges: from raising an army to building a modern global enterprise. Now we see the rise of small, loosely federated groups that use the web to establish agreement and organize action.
