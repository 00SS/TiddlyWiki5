Federatial Limited is a software consultancy founded by JeremyRuston specializing in understanding the impact of the web on the way that we work together.

Through human history we've used hierarchies to organize ourselves to undertake the big challenges of raising an army, organizing a church, or building an enterprise. Now we see the rise of small, loosely federated groups that use the web to establish agreement and organize action, such as the creation of open source software. Federatial is exploring a new wave of collaboration tools that eschew the old, crude hierarchical models of organization.
