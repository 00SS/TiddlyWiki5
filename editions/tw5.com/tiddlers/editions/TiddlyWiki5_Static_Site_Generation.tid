title: TiddlyWiki5 Static Site Generation
tags: edition docs

TiddlyWiki5 can be used to generate a static HTML representation of a TiddlyWiki that doesn't need JavaScript.

! Example

You can explore a static representation of the TiddlyWiki5 site at <a href="static.html">static.html</a>. That file is a static representation of the current DefaultTiddlers. Any tiddlers that it links to are referred to via URLs of the form `/static/HelloThere.html` that point to HTML representations of individual tiddlers.

The included `bld.sh` script includes these commands that are involved in generating the sample static version of the TiddlyWiki5 site:

```
--savetiddler $:/core/templates/static.template.html $TW5_BUILD_OUTPUT/static.html text/plain \
--savetiddlers [!is[shadow]] $:/core/templates/static.tiddler.html $TW5_BUILD_OUTPUT/static text/plain \
```
The SaveTiddlerCommand saves the static version of the DefaulTiddlers and the SaveTiddlersCommand generates the HTML representations of individual tiddlers.
