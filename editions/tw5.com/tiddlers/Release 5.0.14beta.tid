!! Major Changes

!!! Introduction of Upgrade Mechanism

There are two components:

* A more flexible ImportMechanism that:
** Presents incoming tiddlers as a pending import list that allows the user to inspect them and, if necessary, explicitly deselect them from the actual import
** Provides UpgraderModules with an opportunity to process each incoming tiddler
*** The [[plugin upgrader|$:/core/modules/upgraders/plugins.js]] module handles version checking of plugins and upgrading them from a special UpgradeLibrary plugin tiddler
*** The [[system upgrader|$:/core/modules/upgraders/system.js]] module is responsible for suppressing the importing of certain system tiddlers (currently [[$:/StoryList]] and [[$:/HistoryList]])
*** The [[themetweak upgrader|$:/core/modules/upgraders/themetweaks.js]] module handles migrating theme tweaks from their pre-5.0.14-beta format (see below)
* An UpgradePlugin and associated edition that provides a custom, single-purpose user interface for upgrading standalone TiddlyWiki files

!!! PermaView (and PermaLinks) Off by Default

The browser address bar is automatically updated with previous beta releases of TiddlyWiki so that it dynamically reflects the tiddlers that are currently open. This makes it easier to get a permalink for copying and pasting elsewhere, but it leads to much confusion for casual users who don't always understand why unexpected tiddlers are being displayed.

For 5.0.14-beta, the setting has been changed. Visit [[control panel|$:/ControlPanel]] ''Advanced''/''Settings'' to switch the setting back to "Include the target tiddler and the current story sequence".
