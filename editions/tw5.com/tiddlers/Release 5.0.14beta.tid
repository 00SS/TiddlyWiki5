//[[See GitHub for detailed change history of this release|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/compare/v5.0.13-beta...v5.0.14-beta]]//

!! Major Changes

!!! Introduction of Upgrade Mechanism

There are two components:

* A more flexible ImportMechanism that:
** Presents incoming tiddlers as a pending import list that allows the user to inspect them and, if necessary, explicitly deselect them from the actual import
** Provides UpgraderModules with an opportunity to process each incoming tiddler
*** The [[plugin upgrader|$:/core/modules/upgraders/plugins.js]] module handles version checking of plugins and upgrading them from a special UpgradeLibrary plugin tiddler
*** The [[system upgrader|$:/core/modules/upgraders/system.js]] module is responsible for suppressing the importing of certain system tiddlers (currently [[$:/StoryList]] and [[$:/HistoryList]])
*** The [[themetweak upgrader|$:/core/modules/upgraders/themetweaks.js]] module handles migrating theme tweaks from their pre-5.0.14-beta format (see below)
* An UpgradePlugin and associated edition that provides a custom, single-purpose user interface for upgrading standalone TiddlyWiki files
