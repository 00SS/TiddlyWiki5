! Major Improvements

!! Performance Optimisations

This release includes several low-level performance optimisations that should improve speed and responsiveness in many common operations.

* [[Caching the results of parsing a tiddler|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/b0cb17cd83dde89753ec159e27c920a7bf22bee1]]
* [[Loop optimisations|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/c6e48ebc2db4af895f5b3935b3f575b8aab292fe]]
* [[Tiddler iteration optimisations|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/8f63e2a959a7ac44533ae2b6192716ee17a1ce93]]
* [[State qualifier generation|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/848a7f4e744c8f4dcb4ec88a0e99c4ae6aac25e5]]
* [[Caching data tiddlers|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/32f6d7f1b01474b82debcbdd5d76c49c59303265]]
* [[Removed expensive visual effects|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/commit/4f5cf4597abb08af787b62c2e2ee1b8c667dad1e]]

!! Résumé Builder Edition

The new [[Résumé Builder Edition]] by @inmysocks is a custom edition to guide you through the process of using TiddlyWiki to create a good looking résumé (or curriculum vitæ).

!! Blog Edition

The new [[Blog Edition]] provides tools for using TiddlyWiki to create a static HTML blog that can be published on GitHub pages (or similar).

!! Text-Slicer Edition

The new [[Text-Slicer Edition]] is a custom edition with tools to help advanced users slice longer texts up into individual tiddlers.

!! External Text Tiddlers

Limited support for tiddlers stored in external `.tid` files:

* standalone TiddlyWiki HTML files with external text tiddlers can be built under Node.js
* wikis with external text tiddlers can be worked with in the browser, automatically lazily loading the content of external text tiddlers when it is first referenced
** saving changes in the browser doesn't work as expected: if edited, the external text tiddler is replaced with an ordinary tiddler
** lazy loading of external text tiddlers doesn't work in Chrome when viewing the TiddlyWiki HTML file on a ''file:'' URI; it works OK in Firefox. It works on an HTTP URI on all browsers

See [[Alice in Wonderland]] for an example. Try opening it without a network connection.
