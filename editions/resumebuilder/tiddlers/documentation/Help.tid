title: Help

Clicking on [[Resume Wizard]] at the top is a good place to start.

To save your work, either click on the {{$:/core/ui/Buttons/save-wiki}} button to the right or the Save button at the top of the screen. The button to the right will turn red when there are unsaved changes.

How it works:

There are buttons along the top that bring you to the different things you can do with the resume builder. To the right you should see a preview of the completed resume.

*Resume Wizard - A wizard that guides you through a sequence of steps to create a resume.
*Edit Existing Items - An interface to edit already entered information
*Layout Options - Options for changing the order of the sections, which sections are visible, and the templates used for each section.
*Resume Options - Available options for the resume output. The `Layout Options` tab has options for which sections are included in the resume as well as their order and the templates used, the other tabs are for configuring each section individually.
*Preview - Shows a preview of the result, this is also shown on the right side of the screen by default.
*Help - Displays this information.
*Print - Open the resume by itself in a new window for printing.
*Save - saves your changes

<!--
Things to add:

*The section/item order options should get a better way to change the order
*There should be options for other templates for each section
*options for fonts and sizes and so on. Using a settings system like I have for the contacts database would be a good idea.
*More section options
*A reasonable way for users to create custom sections without requiring knowledge of wikitext. This could turn into something rather complex by itself if I let it. I will try to avoid that.
*Other user options?
