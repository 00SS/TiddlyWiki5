# cook.js

This is an attempt to modernise TiddlyWiki's build system, which is based on tools written in Ruby called Cook and Ginsu (see https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/cooker for details). This new version is written in JavaScript for node.js, with the intention that it can share code with TiddlyWiki itself.

## Usage

	node cook.js <recipefile>

Cooks a recipe file and sends the output to STDOUT

	node server.js <recipefile>

Cooks a recipe file and serves it over HTTP port 8000

## Testing

`test.sh` contains a simple test that cooks the main tiddlywiki.com recipe, first with the old Ruby-based tool, and then the new one. It uses OS X's opendiff to display the differences between the two files.

## Current status

As of 22nd November 2011, cook.js can now build a fully functional TiddlyWiki from the existing recipe files. There are still some minor differences in the layout of tiddler attributes, and some whitespace issues that prevent full byte-for-byte compatibility.
