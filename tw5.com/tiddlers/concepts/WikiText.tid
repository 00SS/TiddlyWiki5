WikiText is a concise, expressive way of typing a wide range of text formatting and hypertext features. It allows you to focus on writing without a complex user interface getting in the way.

For example, you can create a link to a tiddler by wrapping its title in double square brackets -- `[[My Tiddler]]` -- or, if the tiddler title conforms to the CamcelCase rules, it is automatically linked without needing the brackets. In this way,  linking become part of the punctuation of your writing.

* Paragraphs

Another key feature of wikitext is the ability to include one tiddler within another (referred to as //transclusion//). For example, one could have a tiddler called //Disclaimer// that contains the boilerplate of a legal disclaimer, and then include it within lots of different tiddlers with the macro call `<<tiddler Disclaimer>>`. 

! This is a heading

HelloThere

One two three four. With a link to HelloThere. And a link to TiddlyWiki and TiddlyWiki5. And a suppressed link to ~HelloThere. And now a [[pretty link|HelloThere]] and another pretty link: [[Introduction]].

Here's an http link: http://www.google.com/, and a suppressed link: ~http://www.apple.com/.

This is a series -- of dashes --- that are of different ---- sizes!

Here's a paragraph with an embedded macro <<image "Motovun Jack.jpg">> and that was it.

{{{
This will be mono
}}}

And this will be {{{inline and monospaced}}} and `so will this` little bit.

Here is some ''bold face'', and __some underlining__ and of course some --strikethrough--.

Here's an unterminated ''bit of bold face. And also some entities like &#xc7; &#199; &quot;HTML Entity&quot;.

Here is a macro <<version>>.

This is a macro with content <<link to:"HelloThere"><This is a //link// to something.>>

This is another macro with content, this time including another macro: <<link to:"HelloThere"><This is a //link// to something in <<version>> of TiddlyWiki.>>. That's that.

! This is a new heading
This is a paragraph
immediately after
that heading

* This is a list
***** With a deep subitem
* Of lots of items
********* And another deep item
** And subitems
*# And nested numbered lists inside ordinary lists
*# Yes
*## Definitely
*##* And then
*##** back
*##*** to items
*## And back to numbers once more
*# More numbering

This is a list with a class wrapped around it:

{{myclass andanotherone{
* One and one
** Two and three
* Four and five
** Six and Seven
}}}

And here's another one:

{{class1 class2{
* Un et deux
**{{class}} Two and three
* Four and five
** Trois et cinq
}}}

And here's a class wrapped around a heading:

{{class1{
! My heading
}}}

And here's a class assigned directly to a heading:

!!!!{{class1}} My very beautiful heading

Here are some HTML paragraph blocks:

<article class="hello">
This is my nice and simple block of text. HelloThere
</article>

And another:

  <article class="hello" mysignal data-thing='Nothing'><div class="another" mysignal2 data-thing='NothingElse'>This time the text is all squashed up, without line breaks</div></article>

---

Macro calls can be inline like this: <<version>>

Or, at paragraph block level:

<<version>>
