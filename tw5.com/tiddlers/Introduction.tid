Here are a few features of TiddlyWiki that you can explore:

* Try editing some tiddlers here on tiddlywiki.com to try out the new WikiText. Your changes will not be visible to other users
* Invoke a demonstration <<button modal param:[[Motovun Jack.jpg]] class:"btn btn-inverse"><wizard>>
* Use TiddlySpot to host an instance of TiddlyWiki5
* Save this wiki as a static HTML file: <<button save-wiki param:"$:/core/templates/static.template.html" class:"btn"><Save Static>>
* If you're running on a touch browser like Mobile Safari on the iPad or iPhone:
** The zooming chooser appears by swiping into the left edge of the screen. (It's currently broken but you get the idea)
** The zooming navigator appears by swiping in from the right edge of the screen. (It currently only works in the 'Classic' storyview)
* Play with the SubStories example to understand how the StoryMechanism works
* Browse the list of AllTiddlers or the ShadowTiddlers
* Examine the example [[bitmap images|Motovun Jack.jpg]] and [[SVG images|Motovun Jack.svg]]
* Explore the RoadMap of TiddlyWiki5's ongoing development
