TiddlyWiki5 gains new capabilities through a [[completely rebuilt architecture|TiddlyWikiArchitecture]] using the latest features of HTML5 and node.js. It runs natively under node.js, and can also use its own components to construct a version of itself that works entirely within the browser, just as TiddlyWiki has always done.
