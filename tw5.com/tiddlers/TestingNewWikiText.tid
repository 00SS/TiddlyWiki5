** Six and Seven
}}}

And here's another one:

{{class1 class2{
* Un et deux
**{{class}} Two and three
* Four and five
** Trois et cinq
}}}

And here's a class wrapped around a heading:

Here are some HTML paragraph blocks:

<article class="hello">
This is my nice and simple block of text. HelloThere
</article>

And another:

  <article class="hello" mysignal data-thing='Nothing'><div class="another" mysignal2 data-thing='NothingElse'>This time the text is all squashed up, without line breaks</div></article>

Macro calls can be inline like this: <<version>>

Or, at paragraph block level:

<<version>>
