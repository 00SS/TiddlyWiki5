title: Improvements
tags: docs introduction

Some of the features that have been improved in TiddlyWiki5:

* TiddlyWiki can now be run under [[node.js|http://nodejs.org]] as well as in the browser
* TiddlyWiki is structured as a 600-line boot kernel, with everything else implemented as plugins
* Improved WikiText, with much better generation of HTML, including proper `<p>` tags
* Tiddlers containing images are now supported just like WikiText tiddlers, including integrated editing of bitmap and SVG images
* Uses standard Twitter Bootstrap CSS (thus enabling the use of Boostrap themes such as http://bootswatch.com)
* Syntax highlighting for JavaScript and JSON tiddlers
* TiddlyWiki5 can directly build both itself and previous (2.6.x) versions of TiddlyWiki from their constituent separate files, without needing external tools
